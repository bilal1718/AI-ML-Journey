# Linear & Logistic Regression

This folder contains my custom implementation of:

- Simple Linear Regression using Batch Gradient Descent
- Multiple Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Multiple Logistic Regression with Log Loss
- Locally Weighted Regression using Normal Equation
- Visualizations of Cost vs Iterations in MLR and newton Method, Recall vs. precision in Newton Method,
   MSE and Log Loss, regression line in SLR
- Comparisons with Scikit-learn
- Newton's Method

## Dataset
- Salary dataset (Simple Linear Regression)
- Student Performance (Multi Linear Regression)
- Weather Forecast dataset (Multi Logistic Regression)

## Files
- `from_scratch/`: Custom ML logic
- `sklearn_comparison/`: Validation using sklearn models
- `README.md`: This guide
