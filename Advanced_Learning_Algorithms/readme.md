# Best Practices for training ML Model

## Evaluating The Model

* Split the data in three parts
  - Training Set
  - Cross Validation Set
  - Test Set

* Train the data in training set and then do cross validation to find the best model out of the all feature models
like which one gives the less loss value.
* Then test the model on test set
